  * Teach students to master the most proven methods in project management as well as exciting new techniques emerging from current industry and today's most recent research with Kloppenborg's CONTEMPORARY PROJECT MANAGEMENT, 3E. This text introduces time-tested manual techniques and progressive automated techniques, all consistent with the latest PMBOK® Guide and integrated with Microsoft® Project 2013. The book's focused approach is ideal for project management courses in both upper-level undergraduate and MBA-level programs. Students practice manual techniques to ensure that they fully grasp the principles behind the methods before learning to use Microsoft® Project 2013, which is fully integrated into nine chapters of this edition, to complete tasks. Throughout the text, students have opportunities to build strong portfolios to showcase their skills in future interviews as they create specific deliverables for real-world projects, whether from working by themselves or as part of a group. To ensure that students understand the established standards in project management today and to prepare them to become Certified Project Management Professionals (PMP®) if they choose, all content in CONTEMPORARY PROJECT MANAGEMENT is consistent with the knowledge areas and processes of the fifth edition of the PMBOK® Guide. For quick reference, a list at the beginning of each chapter highlights the PMBOK® topics covered, and all glossary definitions are consistent with the PMBOK® Guide.
